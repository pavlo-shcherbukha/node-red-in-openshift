## Run on your laptop

1. run 

``` bash
        git clone https://github.com/pavlo-shcherbukha/node-red-in-openshift.git
```

2. run **user-registration.json** in development mode

```bash
npm run dev

```

Then go to http://localhost:1880


3. run **loader.json**

Before you need run **user-registration.json** in the test mode, then run **loader.json** in development mode, because of dependency so:

```bash
        # run  user-registration.json in test mode. 
        # will be accessed on http:/localhost:8080/
        npm run test

        # run loader.json in develpment mode
        # will be accessed on http:/localhost:1880/

        npm run devloader
```


## Deploy on Openshift

- You have to reserve [Red Hat OpenShift sendbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox) 

- Prepare **login CMD file**

- Create  github  secret in case of private repository

- Input correct data in 
    - 1-user-reg_srvc-process.cmd  - deployment for **user-registration.json**
    - 2-loader_srvc-process.cmd - deployment for **loader.json**
    - 1-route-user-reg-process.cmd - router for **user-registration.json**
    - 2-route-loader-process.cmd - router for **loader.json**


- run 
    - 1-user-reg_srvc-process.cmd  - deployment for **user-registration.json**
    - 2-loader_srvc-process.cmd - deployment for **loader.json**
    - 1-route-user-reg-process.cmd - router for **user-registration.json**
